I could manually calculate a frequency, for example, (tf-t0)/n, but I worry that repeatedly adding this timedelta to the start epoch could lead to substantial rounding errors as I near the end epoch. I could switch to working solely with floats instead of datetime objects. (For instance, subtract the start epoch from the end epoch, and divide the timedelta by a unit such as a second, then simply apply numpy linspace..) However, converting everything to floats (and converting back to dates only when necessary) forfeits the benefits of special data types (like simpler code debugging). Is this the optimal solution?
